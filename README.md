- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Built with
- Angular v. 18
- TailwindCSS
- Daisy UI
- Jest as testing framework

### What I learned
In this project I learnt how to use new Angular functionalities and how to structure a web-app that is a little more than a base app.

I also experimented with TailwindCSS and Daisy UI, which are two libraries that I never used before.
I tried to enhance code readability and maintainability by using Husky as a pre-commit hook and Jest as a testing framework.
